      value: I close my eyes, tell us why must we suffer  
             Release your hands, for your will drags us under
             My Legs grow tired, tell us where must we wander
             How can we carry on, if redemption's beyond us

             To listen to suffer to entrust unto tomorrow
             In one fleeting moment from the land doth life flow
             Yet in one fleeting moment for anew it doth grow
             In the same fleeting moment thou must live die and know
