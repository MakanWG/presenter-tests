    I close my eyes, tell us why must we suffer  
    Release your hands, for your will drags us under
    My Legs grow tired, tell us where must we wander
    How can we carry on, if redemption's beyond us

    Thy life is a riddle to bear rapture and sorrow
    To listen to suffer to entrust unto tomorrow
    In one fleeting moment from the land doth life flow
    Yet in one fleeting moment for anew it doth grow
    In the same fleeting moment thou must live die and know
